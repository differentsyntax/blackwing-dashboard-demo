Blackwing Demo

### About

Designed and implemented a few components (in-progress) browsed through during the intro call with Zorayr, Nov 7. Used React, TypeScript and TailwindCSS.

I enjoyed my conversation with Zo and wanted to double down on my interest in working for Blackwing by showcasing that I am a go-getter, constantly learning and have decent experience working with the tech mentioned above. I admit that this is the first time I have built a chart component completely without using any external libraries, and it might have a few responsive issues. I will be improving it incrementally and will be building upon this webpage further with fixing of the responsive issues, addition of the real-time data displaying card-component, and unit testing. 

I am ready to join the team immediately at a level you believe would be suitable for me but my main priority is to get better at UI development, learn from the best, mentor the best eventually, and do my best day in and day out. I bring to the table an infectious energy, move-fast mindset, and a love for New York City.
